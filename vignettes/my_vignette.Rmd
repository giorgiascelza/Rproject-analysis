# Project Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive vignette for the `Rproject` package, an R library developed to streamline the analysis of 10x Genomics single-cell multi-omic (gene expression + ATAC-seq) data.

The primary goal is to provide a reproducible and modular workflow, from raw data loading to final visualization. We will process both the gene expression and chromatin accessibility data to explore the relationship between chromatin state and gene regulation. The entire project is encapsulated in a Docker container to ensure complete reproducibility of the environment and the analysis.

# Installation and Environment Setup

A core requirement of this project is full reproducibility. To achieve this, a self-contained computational environment was created using Docker and distributed via Docker Hub. This ensures that the analysis can be executed on any machine with Docker installed, eliminating issues related to software versions or system dependencies.

## Project Components

The entire project is organized into two key public resources:

1.  **GitHub Repository:** Contains all the source code, including the `Rproject` package and the `Dockerfile` used to build the computational environment.
    -   **Link:** `https://github.com/giorgiascelza/Rproject-analysis`
2.  **Docker Hub Image:** Contains the pre-built, ready-to-use Docker image with all software and packages pre-installed.
    -   **Link:** `https://hub.docker.com/r/giorgiascelza/image-seurat-signac`

## Replicating the Analysis

To replicate this analysis, please follow these steps on a machine with Docker installed.

**Step 1: Pull the Docker Image from Docker Hub**

First, download the pre-built Docker image. This command will fetch the complete environment with all software and packages pre-installed.

``` bash
docker pull giorgiascelza/image-seurat-signac:latest
```

**Step 2: Run the Docker Container**

Once the image is downloaded, start a container. We will also mount a local directory (e.g., `analysis_results`) to the container, allowing us to save the final report from inside the container to our own computer.

``` bash
# Create a local directory for the results (if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p analysis_results

# Run the container and access its command line (bash)
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/analysis_results":/project/results \
  giorgiascelza/image-seurat-signac:latest
```

After running this command, your terminal prompt will change, indicating you are now inside the container.

**Step 3: Regenerate the Report (Inside the Container)**

Now that you are inside the container, start an R session by typing `R` and pressing Enter. Once in the R environment, you can re-run this vignette to generate the final HTML report.

``` r
# --- Start an R session by typing 'R' in the container's terminal ---

# The Rproject package is already installed, so we can find its vignette
vignette_path <- system.file("doc", "my_vignette.Rmd", package = "Rproject")

# Render the report. The output will be saved in the mounted results folder.
rmarkdown::render(
  vignette_path,
  output_dir = "/project/results"
)

# You can now exit R (with q()) and the container (with 'exit').
```

After exiting the container, you will find the `my_vignette.html` file in the `analysis_results` folder on your computer.

# Challenges in Package Development

This section describes the technical challenges faced during development and the strategies used to overcome them.

1.  **Package Installation and Rtools:** The initial `R CMD check` failed because the necessary build tools (Rtools) were not installed or were of an incompatible version. **Solution:** The correct version of Rtools (Rtools45) was installed, and the system `PATH` was configured via the `.Renviron` file to ensure R could find the compilers.

2.  **Dependency Management in `NAMESPACE`:** The primary challenge was correctly declaring dependencies for Bioconductor's S4 methods (`counts`, `rowData`, etc.). Initial attempts using `@importFrom` failed because these generic functions are not formally exported. **Solution:** The `NAMESPACE` was stabilized by importing the packages that define these generics (`BiocGenerics`, `S4Vectors`, `SummarizedExperiment`) in their entirety using `@import`.

3.  **`data.table` and `ggplot2` Global Variables:** `R CMD check` issued `NOTE`s for "no visible binding for global variable" for terms like `.`, `feature`, and `seqnames`, which are used in non-standard evaluation. **Solution:** A file `R/globals.R` was created with a `utils::globalVariables()` call to explicitly declare these terms, silencing the `NOTE`s.

# Full Analysis Workflow

This section demonstrates the use of the `Rproject` package to perform the end-to-end analysis. The workflow is executed by calling the exported functions in sequence.

### Setup: Defining Paths

First, we define the paths to the input data and a temporary output directory. For this report, we use the example data included within the package itself.

```{r setup_paths}
example_data_dir <- system.file("extdata", "mini_pbmc3k", package = "Rproject")
example_gtf_path <- system.file("extdata", "mini_annotation.gtf.gz", package = "Rproject")
output_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "analysis_results")
if (!dir.exists(output_dir)) {
  dir.create(output_dir)
}

cat("Using example data from:", example_data_dir, "\n")
cat("Saving results to:", output_dir, "\n")
```

### Step 1: Load and Convert Matrix

The analysis starts by loading the raw data from the 10x Genomics output folder. The `load_and_convert_matrix()` function reads the sparse matrix and its annotations, converting it into a dense `data.table` object for efficient processing.

```{r step_1_load}
dt_matrix <- load_and_convert_matrix(data_folder = example_data_dir)
cat("Data loaded. Dimensions of the full matrix:", dim(dt_matrix)[1], "features,", dim(dt_matrix)[2] -1, "cells.\n")
```

### Step 2: Split Gene Expression and ATAC-seq Data

From the combined `data.table`, we separate the gene expression (GEX) data from the ATAC-seq peak data. This is done by identifying rows based on their feature names: Ensembl gene IDs (`ENSG...`) for expression, and genomic coordinates (`chr...`) for peaks.

```{r step_2_split}
data_list <- split_data(dt_matrix = dt_matrix)
cat("Gene Expression (GEX) data dimensions:", dim(data_list$expression), "\n")
cat("ATAC-seq Peak data dimensions:", dim(data_list$peaks), "\n")
```

### Step 3: Summarize Data

For each dataset, we compute the total counts for each gene and the total accessibility for each peak region across all cells. This reduces the data to a single vector per modality, representing the overall signal for each feature.

```{r step_3_summarize}
summary_list <- summarize_data(data_list = data_list)
cat("Top 5 summarized expression features:\n")
kable(head(summary_list$expression_summary, 5))
```

### Step 4: Create GenomicRanges Objects

To perform genomic coordinate-based operations, we convert our summarized data into `GRanges` objects. This data structure is ideal for handling genomic data. The summarized counts are stored as metadata.

```{r step_4_granges}
granges_list <- create_granges_objects(
  summary_list = summary_list,
  gtf_file_path = example_gtf_path
)
cat("Created GRanges object for Expression data:\n")
print(granges_list$gr_expr)
```

### Step 5 & 6: Annotate Peaks and Finalize Data

In these steps, we link the ATAC-seq peaks to genes by finding overlaps between them. We focus only on protein-coding genes to ensure a consistent feature set between the two modalities. Gene symbols are also added for better readability.

```{r step_5_and_6_map_and_finalize}
mapping_list <- map_peaks_to_genes(granges_list = granges_list)
gr_expr_pc <- finalize_expression_data(mapping_list = mapping_list)

cat(sprintf(
  "Found %d overlaps between %d ATAC peaks and %d protein-coding genes.\n",
  length(mapping_list$overlaps),
  length(granges_list$gr_peaks),
  length(mapping_list$gtf_pc)
))
```

### Step 7: Normalize and Integrate Data

This is a critical step where both datasets are normalized using the **Counts Per Million (CPM)** method to account for differences in sequencing depth. After normalization, we aggregate ATAC signals by gene and analyze features that could not be integrated.

```{r step_7_integrate, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
annotated_list <- list(
  gr_expr_pc = gr_expr_pc,
  gr_peaks = granges_list$gr_peaks,
  overlaps = mapping_list$overlaps
)

step7_results <- normalize_and_integrate(
  data_list = data_list,
  annotated_list = annotated_list
)

# Display summary tables and plots
kable(step7_results$summaries_and_plots$summary_unmapped_peaks, 
      caption = "Summary of ATAC peaks that could not be mapped to a gene.")
step7_results$summaries_and_plots$plot_unmapped_peaks

kable(step7_results$summaries_and_plots$summary_genes_no_atac,
      caption = "Summary of genes that have no associated ATAC peak signal.")
step7_results$summaries_and_plots$plot_genes_no_atac
```

### Step 8: Visualize and Save Final Results

The final step is to visualize the relationship between gene expression and chromatin accessibility for the integrated genes. We generate a scatter plot, faceted by chromosome for clarity.

```{r step_8_visualize, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
visualize_and_save(
  step7_results = step7_results,
  output_folder = output_dir
)
```

**Note on Visualization:** The plot generated in this step may appear empty or display a message indicating "No data to display". This is an expected outcome when running the analysis on the provided `mini_pbmc3k` example dataset. Due to its reduced size, after all filtering and integration steps, there may be no remaining data points that satisfy the criteria for visualization. The functions are designed to handle this scenario gracefully without producing an error, and will generate complete plots when run on a full-sized dataset.

**Interpretation:** The final scatter plots illustrate the correlation between a gene's expression level and the accessibility of its associated chromatin regions. A general positive trend, where higher accessibility corresponds to higher expression, supports the biological hypothesis that open chromatin is a prerequisite for active transcription. Deviations from this trend can highlight genes under more complex regulatory control.

# Conclusion

The `Rproject` package successfully provides a structured, reproducible, and robust workflow for the integrated analysis of single-cell multi-omic data. By encapsulating the logic in a modular package and ensuring environmental consistency with Docker, this project establishes a reliable foundation for complex bioinformatics analyses. The entire pipeline, from raw data to final plots, can be executed seamlessly, as demonstrated in this vignette.
