\title{Step 6: Finalize Expression Data}
\usage{
finalize_expression_data(mapping_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping_list}{A list containing `gtf_pc`, the GRanges object for
protein-coding genes, as produced by `map_peaks_to_genes()`.}
}
\value{
A finalized GRanges object (`gr_expr_pc`) containing only
  protein-coding genes, ready for the normalization step.
}
\description{
This function takes the set of protein-coding genes identified in the previous
step and performs final preparations, such as renaming metadata columns for
clarity (e.g., from 'gene_name' to 'gene_symbol').
